# Next.js Blog

Welcome to my Next.js blog! This project showcases my skills using Next.js for building a simple yet functional blog. I decided to create a blog to demonstrate my proficiency in Next.js and Firebase.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Utilized for server-side rendering and routing.
- **Firebase**: Integrated for database management, particularly for storing contact details.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the blog to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **Vercel**: Deployed the blog live using Vercel's platform.
